			box to type your message and a "Send" button.
			Also, it's fixed to the bottom of the screen so 
			if a lot of messages come in, you don't have to scroll
			to the bottom to send a message.
			As you can see, you can click the send-button, but 
			it isn't doing anything cause we don't have any
			Javascript hooked up to it.

			In general, check out the list of Bootstrap components
			to get some cool HTML elements to add to your page.
			Feel free to explore it, you might recognize that you've
			seen this style of elements before.
